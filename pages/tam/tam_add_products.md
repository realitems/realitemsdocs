## Product Templates 

By creating **product templates**, you are telling the Real Items system which types of products can be digitized on the blockchain.  By stepping through and filling out the product template form, you add a **product** that is available for creation to the blockchain.  Product templates include, plain text, URLs, images, videos and documents.  Assets included in the templates (images, videos, etc.) are pushed to IPFS and are thereafter referenced via an IPFS-based URL.  

## Adding a new product template
