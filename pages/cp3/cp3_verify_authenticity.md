## Digital Identities and Authenticity

Verifying the authenticity of an item means ensuring that the digital identity and PIN matches the item.   This is usually done by scanning the QR code on an item and then providing in the accompanying PIN.  After the  verification process is completed successfully, you can be sure the item is authentic.

## Finding the QR Code

The QR Code for an item can be found:

* On the outside of the item
* On the outside of the packaging
* Inside the packaging on a receipt

## Scanning the QR Code

There are two ways to scan the QR Code:

### First method: Stock Camera

* Point the camera at the QR Code and click the link when prompted
